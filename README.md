This is the official repository for the "Introduction to Python using Google Colab", Adriana STAN, 2022 (to appear).

You can find the PDF version of the book in the `pdf/` folder and all the associated notebooks in the `notebooks/ro/` folder. Colab badges can be found in each notebook so that you can easily open and run them.

For now, the book and notebooks are in Romanian, but an English version will be soon made available.
